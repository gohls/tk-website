This website was create for a friend, who writes poems.

_It, furthermore, serves as a showcase for my endeavors in the realm of software development. I have outlined some of my thoughts and insights around the development of it._

## Folder Structure

The folder structure draws inspiration from certain conventions employed in Next.js, exemplified by the presence of folders like `routes`, `layout`, and `pages`. These conventions enhance code readability, maintainability, and overall organization, especially as the project grows.

Otherwise, the folder structure follow common/best practices, such as grouping `components`, `apis`, `utils`, etc.

## apis

## components

This folder consists of reusable UI components, such as cards, links,paper, errors, and more as needed.

## utils

This folder consists of some repeatedly used functions that are commonly used in the project like data formatting.
