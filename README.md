This website was create for a friend, who writes poems. Visit [Tom Kuhn Poetry](https://tk-website.vercel.app/) to see site.

_It, furthermore, serves as a showcase for my endeavors in the realm of software development. I have outlined some of my thoughts and insights around the development of it._

## Dev Notes

This website is built using [React](https://react.dev/), while [Notion](https://tom-kuhn-poetry.notion.site/tom-kuhn-poetry/579da44c286942dba67c8c8d5ca0390b?v=7cb5edff85794e2791b91a716187cba4) serves as the backend. (WIP)

## Folder Structure

The folder structure draws inspiration from certain conventions employed in Next.js, exemplified by the presence of folders like `routes`, `layout`, and `pages`. These conventions enhance code readability, maintainability, and overall organization, especially as the project grows.

Otherwise, the folder structure follow common/best practices, such as grouping `components`, `apis`, `utils`, etc.
